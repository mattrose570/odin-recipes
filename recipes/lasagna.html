    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> This lasagna recipe is one of the better ones. And it's even made with squash! </p>

    <h2>Lasagna History</h2>

        <p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed test about lasagna, appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary;[4][5] while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery).[6] It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.[7] Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients (yields 12 servings)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Marsala wine</li>
            <li>28 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh basil, leaves stripped from stems</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander and place over a bowl to drain.</li>
            <li>While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a 4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and immediately top with thin basil slices. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
